# Java-Database-Connectivity-Mini-Project
During the summer of 2018, I worked with a Computer Science Professor named Xiaolin Hu for two weeks on a project that he was working on. My job was to write a program that displays user information (login time, username, password) of a virtual classroom; the program also stores the users' information into the database accordingly whenever they login on to the virtual classroom. After finishing my program, I wrote a project report and sent it to Dr. Hu.
